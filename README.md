# NLW eSports | Prisma ORM & TypeScript

![banner](banner.png)

> Project made at `NLW (Next Level Week)`, an online event held by Rocketseat. In this project taught by Diego Schell Fernandes,
> the ORM Prisma was presented for the development of APIs in the backend, as well as the importance of `TypeScript` (a super set of the
> JavaScript to leave your code statically typed in both the backend and frontend of the application). From the base project made in this event
> added some new features to make the project more functional, like login with Google, admins can add, edit and delete
> games through the frontend of the application, pagination, and the main feature of creating ads and deleting them whenever you want on the ad page.
